# Contributing to Olli

If you find a bug in the code or a mistake on the [documentation site](https://mitvis.github.io/olli/), or if you would like to request a new feature, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mitvis/olli/issues), or even better, submit a pull request.

For small fixes, please feel free to submit a pull request directly: don't worry about creating an issue first. For major changes, please discuss with us first. To ensure the discussion is visible and open for comments, please submit a new issue that we can tag with the discussion label.

If you would like to make multiple unrelated modifications, please separate them into separate pull requests for independent review and merging. If making significant inter-related modifications, please try to provide a logical sequence of piecewise commits rather than one giant commit spanning many files (as is feasible). Please also include appropriate test cases for ensuring correctness. Feel free to reach out for help or confirmation if you have questions on how to best proceed!
