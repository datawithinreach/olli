    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The default accessible rendering using <em>Olli</em> is an <em>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</em>
        Tree View based on the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/treeview/treeview-navigation.html"
            target="_blank">W3C Navigation TreeView Example</a>. Olli represents accessible visualizations
        hierarchically, as
        a tree structure containing descriptions at varying levels of information granularity. The root node contains a
        high-level overview of the visualization. If the visualization has multiple views, the level below the root
        contains a node for each view. The next level contains nodes representing guides (axes and legends). Each guide
        node has children representing intervals and categories for continuous and discrete guides, respectively.
        Finally, the leaves of the tree contains the individual data points that correspond to those intervals and
        categories. The tree allows users to leverage a visualization's hierarchical structure to drill down into data,
        rather than being restricted to reading individual data points linearly or in a table.
    </p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>
        The accessible rendering can be selected by clicking on the root tree node with your mouse, additionally
        pressing the <code><strong>t</strong></code> key will also focus on the navigable structure. Once focused on a
        node, arrow keys
        can then be used to traverse the tree structurally (i.e., <em>up and down</em> to move between levels, <em>left
            and right</em> to move between siblings). As the AccessibilityTreeNode is traversed, tree nodes that have
        children are rendered as a nested unordered list with a group role and aria-expanded attribute. Otherwise, a
        node is rendered as a list item with a treeitem ARIA role. The addition of the ARIA roles and extra attributes
        allow the screen reader to provide a more specific description of the node's position of the treeBelow is an
        example of a simple scatterplot with the tree view structure to test the navigation:
