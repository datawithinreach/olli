    Below is an example of how Olli can be used to create an accessible visualization rendering. You can select the
    different adapters to see the example code to make the accessible rendering followed by the visualization, and
    finally the navigable tree view of the visualization. The accessible rendering can be selected by clicking on the
    root tree node with your mouse, additionally
    pressing the <code><strong>t</strong></code> key will also focus on the navigable structure. Once focused on a node,
    arrow keys can then be used to traverse the tree structurally (i.e., <em>up and down</em> to move between levels,
    <em>left and right</em> to move between siblings). As the AccessibilityTreeNode is traversed, tree nodes that have
    children are rendered as a nested unordered list with a group role and aria-expanded attribute. Otherwise, a
    node is rendered as a list item with a treeitem ARIA role. The addition of the ARIA roles and extra attributes
    allow the screen reader to provide a more specific description of the node's position of the treeBelow is an
    example of a simple scatterplot with the tree view structure to test the navigation:
