        Olli is a library that creates a standard and scalable
        infrastructure for accessible web-based visualizations by embedding a navigable tree that users can explore for a
        richer screen reader experience. Adapters specific to different visualization libaries break down a chart where
        an accessible rendering is then created using existing ARIA TreeView technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using an adapter design pattern, Olli can be extended to support any JavaScript visualization library by
        implementing a function that adapts existing chart instances into a standard <code>OlliVisSpec</code> interface.
        This
        interface details its structural, hierarchical, and visual components, that are then rendered as a tree view in
        HTML compatible with the <em>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) standard</em>.
