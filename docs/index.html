        Olli is an open-source library for converting data visualizations into accessible text structures for screen reader users.
        Starting with an existing visualization specification created with a supported toolkit, Olli produces a keyboard-navigable tree view with descriptions at varying levels of detail.
        Users can explore these structures both to get an initial overview, and to dive into the data in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Olli comes with built-in support for visualizations created in <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a>, <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>, and <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot">Observable Plot</a>.
        Using an adapter design pattern, Olli can be extended to support any JavaScript visualization library by
        implementing a function that adapts existing chart instances into a standard <code>OlliVisSpec</code> interface.
        With the adapter pattern, developers can extend support to new toolkits while re-using the Olli renderer, which implements best practices according to the <em>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) standard</em>.
